# Create-Discord-Bot-Workshop


                                   
## Update Node.js     

at least v: 16.9.0 

## Create a Bot and link it to your Discord server

You can set up your bot on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## config your config.json like the example (or do a .env)
## **git clone**

## **npm i**

## Have Fun

When you add a Slash command, don't forget to **node deploy-commands.js**.
Otherwise, just do **node .** to run the bot and put it online.

I suggest you strongly to read the [official documentation](https://discordjs.guide/) to help you set up the bot
